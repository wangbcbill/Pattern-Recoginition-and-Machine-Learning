0. Exercise on Classification using Deep Learning and CNN 
Experience the training and testing of problems in machine learning

1. Face modeling by AAM Model, Auto-encoder and FLD 
How many bits do you need to represent a face? Or telling apart male from female faces? 

2. Face detection by AdaBoost and RealBoost 
How many features do you need to detect a face in a crowd? 

3. Object detection by Fast-RCNN 
How to detect the class of an object and its location? 

4. Face social attributes and sentiment analysis by SVM 
How do we measure the social dimensions of faces in political elections and social network?
