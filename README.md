0. Exercise on Classification using Deep Learning and CNN: Experience the training and testing of problems in machine learning

1. Face modeling by AAM Model, Auto-encoder and FLD: How many bits do you need to represent a face? Or telling apart male from female faces? 

2. Face detection by AdaBoost and RealBoost: How many features do you need to detect a face in a crowd? 

3. Face social attributes and sentiment analysis by SVM: How do we measure the social dimensions of faces in political elections and social network?
